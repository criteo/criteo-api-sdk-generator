# {{artifactDescription}}

## Introduction
API Client Libraries can facilitate your use of the Criteo API allowing you to build unique and customized solutions to serve your businesses and clients.
These libraries can reduce the amount of code you need to write in order to start accessing Criteo programmatically. They also can help expedite troubleshooting, should you encounter any issues.
This Transition SDK will help you migrate from MAPI to Criteo API. We will support it until end of 2021 when we will decommission the /legacy endpoints. After that date we will only support our official versioned Client Libraries available in Q3 2021.

## Requirements

Building the API client library requires:

1. Java 1.8+
2. Maven/Gradle

## Installation

To install the API client library to your local Maven repository, simply execute:

```shell
mvn clean install
```

or

```shell
gradle install
```

To deploy it to a remote Maven repository instead, configure the settings of the repository and execute:

```shell
mvn clean deploy
```

Refer to the [OSSRH Guide](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html) for more information.

### Maven users

Add this dependency to your project's POM:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>{{{groupId}}}</groupId>
  <artifactId>{{{artifactId}}}</artifactId>
  <version>{{{artifactVersion}}}</version>
  <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle users

Add this dependency to your project's build file:

```groovy
compile "{{{groupId}}}:{{{artifactId}}}:{{{artifactVersion}}}"
```

### Others

At first generate the JAR by executing:

```shell
mvn clean package
```

Then manually install the following JARs:

* `target/{{{artifactId}}}-{{{artifactVersion}}}.jar`
* `target/lib/*.jar`

## Example
Please see [src/examples/java/com/criteo/marketing/](src/examples/java/com/criteo/marketing/) for full examples to get a valid token and make a call to the API.
